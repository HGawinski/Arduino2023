MicroPython with Arduino
========================

Arduino added the MicroPython as an additional option for programming Arduino microcontrollers, 
and supports the official MicroPython project by contributing to the upstream repo. 
On this [page](https://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/), you can find the current status of our MicroPython-powered software.

Arduino has developed MicroPython support for the following boards:
- Nano BLE Sense
- Nano RP2040 Connect
- Nano ESP32
- GIGA R1
- Nicla Vision
- Portenta H7 

To load MicroPython scripts to your board, you need to use a code editor.   
You can choose between two editors: [Arduino Lab for MicroPython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython) and [OpenMV](https://openmv.io/pages/download).  

Here, you will find some example code for MicroPython on Arduino.
